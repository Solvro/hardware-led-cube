# generator

I made this mostly for myself, to generate some cool animations for mock. We will see later if it's any useful

## usage

cd to root folder of this repo and

```sh
python -m frame_generator.main
```

## json format

### Prototype

We need to agree on a JSON format, I will change state_parser later to generate correct JSONs
